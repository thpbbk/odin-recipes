Recipe website
Tis is a project that I will be working on as a part of my portfolio.
I have been following The Odin Project to learn Full Stack Web Development and this project is the part of the curriculum.
In this project, I will be creating a website that basically contains Homepage and 3 other ppages showing the differrent recipes.
I will be using various basic HTML tags and elements to start on this project.
Once I create a homepage, and other 3 webpages showing the recipes, I will then create a link between those webpages to mark off this project as completed.
Trying to undertand about git commiting.
